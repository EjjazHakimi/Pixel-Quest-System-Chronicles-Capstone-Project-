# Pixel-Quest-System-Chronicles-Capstone-Project-

Pixel Quest is a Gamified E-Learning Platform System for SYAD Learning among APU students. This project was made as my Capstone Project for my diploma programme. Pixel Quest combines both Web Design and Game Design to deliver a unique method towards learning SYAD. This repository contains the .exe file and .sql file needed to run the game. If the .exe file cannot be downloaded for whatever reason, feel free to download the zip file located on my itch.io page in the link below
